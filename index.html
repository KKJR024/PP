            <h3>About <span>ME</span></h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Kristian Karani! I'm a programmer with a keen eye for creative solutions. I leverage my skills in Bash, Python, and web development to bring innovative ideas to life. My interests lie in Linux networking and cybersecurity, and I enjoy infusing my artistic sensibilities into everything I code.</p>

            <div><h4><span>Background</span></h4>
            <p>I'm a computer science undergraduate hailing from Nairobi, Kenya, with a growing passion for cybersecurity. My interest sparked in 2019, and since then I've delved into the world of ethical hacking and penetration testing through books like "Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing Guide" by Rafay Baloch and "Linux Basics for Hackers" by Occupy the Web. This journey has equipped me with the fundamentals of cybersecurity, and I'm eager to keep learning and growing in this dynamic field.</p>
        </div>
            <div><h4><span>Current Focus</span></h4>
            <p>Currently, I'm channeling my passion for technology into practical applications. I'm part of a developer group called Keynote, and together we're building an innovative mobile app called GlycoSafe. This app focuses on image-based dietary assessment, specifically designed to calculate the glycemic load of consumed foods. GlycoSafe empowers users to make informed dietary choices by leveraging the power of technology and health awareness.</p>
        </div>
            <div><h4><span>Looking Forward</span></h4>
            <p>Balancing education and my passion for cybersecurity is key.  I'm aiming to finish my CS degree while building my skills as a network engineer and continuing to learn penetration testing.  The future also holds exciting collaborations with Keynote on software solutions -  we're a team that thrives on innovation!</p>
